        Iâ€™m a recent graduate of <strong>West Visayas State University</strong>{" "}
        with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, majoring in Business
        Application Development. I specialize in building web-based applications
        and have hands-on experience with technologies like React.js, Vue.js,
        Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through thoughtful and
        practical software, and I'm currently seeking my first opportunity to
        grow as a developer, contribute to a team, and build meaningful
        solutions.
